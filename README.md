# What is this?

This is a different way to do administration via a CMS. It's focussed on administration flows, not content taxonomy.

##What?

Content Management Systems do two things. First, they hold a bunch of content. Second, they provide the means to manage it. While the vast majority of Content Management Systems do the first thing pretty well, they only make small concessions towards the latter. This is a topsy-turvy Content Management System: more of a Managing Content System. It's built with emphasis on the *way* that people manage content, rather than the content itself. It'll make for faster, friendlier content administration.
